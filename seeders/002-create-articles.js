            "It had been very well advertised that the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium was supposed to be hosting this match, but Wembley stepped in at short notice after construction delays. For many fans, this was not an unwelcome move given how perfect the stadium remains as a home for NFL games in the UK. The atmosphere was surprisingly special as the Seahawks ran out 27-3 winners with the visitors reflecting afterwards on it feeling like a home game." +
            "\"It felt like a home game,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. \"Not only were they so much for us, they made it hard on the other team as well. I know that Germany supports us well and the people here in Great Britain supported us as well, and I’m sure there’s a bunch of other people who came, as well as our own fans who made the trip. We’re grateful for them, it made it a very special event today.\"" +
            "The Jacksonville Jaguars have particularly made Wembley their second home, but there is no doubting its suitability for hosting the masses of UK and Europe-based NFL fans regardless of their team affiliation. From the 'tailgate' zones and the fan plazas to the stadium entertainment itself, Wembley is still the ideal place to enjoy the NFL's UK jaunts.",
